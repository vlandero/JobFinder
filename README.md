# JobFinder
Job finding application. The user can have 2 roles: Job Finder or Recruiter. They have custom dashboards for seeing their application statuses (as a finder), or people who applied for their job (as a recruiter). Recruiters have control over the applications for the jobs they posted, so they can update the status of the candidates, accept or reject them. Companies can have multiple recruiters, who can post multiple jobs.
The connection between the finder and the recruiter is maximal, as it is very important to keep them updated with what any of them does :)

Used Angular and .NET for development.
